the run_analysis.R script reads training and test data from a dataset then merges them into one dataset. The script then extracts only variables with mean and standard deviation measurements taking into account the different ways these can be specificied. Descriptive names are used for the activities in the data set as well as appropriate labels for the variable names. A second independent tidy dataset is created that contains the average of each variable for each activitz and subject. The script writes the tidy dataset and feature names to two txt files.

Codebook.md contains list of variable names in the tidy dataset
